What if you could use your Raspberry Pi as easily as you could with your
ESP8266/ESP32 with ESPHome? Drop a yaml file and go? periphhome is that!

periphhome implements the protocol used by [esphome.io](https://esphome.io) in
Go.

Since the protocol is the same, periphhome devices show up in Home Assistant
automatically with no configuration! See
[home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome).
